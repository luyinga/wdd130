        Hello! My name is Luyinga Lumbale Leonard and I am from Kinshasa D.R.Congo I enjoy reading
        and play football. I am actually living in Cape Town. I am married and have two children.
        I am doing web design because I want to know how to create websites. I am a returned missionnary
        I hope working in a company as a front-end developper in Cape Town. I like going out, my favorite 
        food is chicken gatsby. I like to ride a bike, I like the gospel of Jesus-Christ because 
        it shows me the way to go to our heavenly father because in john 3:16 Jesus said For God so loved 
        the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, 
        but have everlasting life.
