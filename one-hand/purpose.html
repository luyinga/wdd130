        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>
            As homelessness due to drug addiction becomes more visible in our cities there are many people who wonder if offering basic
            aid such as food, water, and clothing is enabling unhealthy behaviors. At Blanchet House of Hospitality, we believe it is a
            moral imperative to feed hungry, homeless people whether they suffer with drug addiction or other challenges. Compassion can
            open doors to recovery and a healthier future for all.When discussing the issue of helping the poor and feeding the homeless,
            it is crucial to address the specific challenges faced by individuals grappling with drug addiction. At Blanchet House of
            Hospitality, it is our founding mission to extend compassion and aid to all marginalized people and this includes people 
            who use drugs and alcohol. By offering support through nourishment, we not only address peopleâ€™s immediate needs but also
            pave the way for a path to recovery and a chance at a better life.
