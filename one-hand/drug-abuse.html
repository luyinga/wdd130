        <h1>Drug-Abuse</h1>
        <p>
            Drug abuse is something that ruins one’s life and leads to great grief and misery. Drug abuse implies the use of drugs in a 
            way that harms the body of an individual. If drugs are taken beyond the subscribed limit, they negatively affect the body and
            poses a great threat to life. It leads to serious mental and physical deterioration. Drug abuse not only affects the 
            individual who is a victim to it but also destroys and tears apart their family and love life. People who are victims of
            drug abuse also suffer from financial loss as they do not have the potential to do any kind of work and thus it leads to
            unemployment and greater family issues.There are numerous reasons behind drug abuse, let take an insight into the things
            that lead to drug abuse . Many parents nowadays do not focus on their children as they are much busy earning their 
            livelihood. However, the children feel ignorant and thus start using drugs at an increased level which makes them addicted
            to it and ultimately make them drug addicts. So parents need to supervise their children so as to avoid such situations.  
            Then comes lack of communication, teenagers and their parents are unable to talk to each other over certain issues due to
            age gap and thus teenagers seek advice from other people who may convince them to take a drug overdose. So it’s high time
            that parents should become friends to their children and listen to their problems patiently.
