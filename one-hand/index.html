        <h1>Homeless</h1>
        <p>
            Imagine waking up outside on the cold ground, instead of in a warm cozy bed. Even worse, imagine rummaging through a trash
            can for your next meal not knowing what you will find. People that are homeless know these images all too well. Being homeless
            is a lifestyle that many people face today, but your community can help. Helping the homeless out can be an easy task, but
            also a rewarding task as well. Anything given to homeless people is appreciated. From a quarter to a bottle of water, these 
            are items that people need to survive. According to statistics, nearly 200,000 people in South Africa are homeless.
            This ranges from people with disabilities to our Veterans as well. 10% of the population are considered chronically homeless. 
            This occurs when an individual has a disability and has been homeless for a year or longer. As for our Veterans, nearly 5% of 
            them fit into the homeless category and the number continues to rise. It is uncomforting to think that the person you pass on 
            the street could have been a man or women who fought for the freedom of this country a year, or even months earlier.
            Donâ€™t treat the homeless as if they were invisible. Acknowledge them by speaking and showing them respect regardless of what
            they may look like. There are different ways to help like donating non- perishable items, clothing, coats, blankets, working 
            in food banks, getting job fairs to visit the community or even just passing out a bottle of water. We could also provide
            care packages that include shampoo, body wash, deodorant, a hairbrush, toothpaste, a toothbrush and five dollars for them 
            to buy something of their choice or even just treating them to a meal. These are just few of many items that we could donate
            to help the shelters.
