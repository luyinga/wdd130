      <p>
        Imagine waking up outside on the cold ground, instead of in a warm cozy bed. Even worse, imagine rummaging through a trash
        can for your next meal not knowing what you will find. People that are homeless know these images all too well. Being homeless
        is a lifestyle that many people face today, but your community can help. Helping the homeless out can be an easy task, but
        also a rewarding task as well. Anything given to homeless people is appreciated. From a quarter to a bottle of water, these 
        are items that people need to survive. According to statistics, nearly 200,000 people in South Africa are homeless.
        This ranges from people with disabilities to our Veterans as well. 10% of the population are considered chronically homeless. 
        This occurs when an individual has a disability and has been homeless for a year or longer. As for our Veterans, nearly 5% of 
        them fit into the homeless category and the number continues to rise. It is uncomforting to think that the person you pass on 
        the street could have been a man or women who fought for the freedom of this country a year, or even months earlier.
        Don’t treat the homeless as if they were invisible. Acknowledge them by speaking and showing them respect regardless of what
        they may look like. There are different ways to help like donating non- perishable items, clothing, coats, blankets, working 
        in food banks, getting job fairs to visit the community or even just passing out a bottle of water. We could also provide
        care packages that include shampoo, body wash, deodorant, a hairbrush, toothpaste, a toothbrush and five dollars for them 
        to buy something of their choice or even just treating them to a meal. These are just few of many items that we could donate
        to help the shelters.

      <h3>Drug Abuse</h3>
      <p>
        Drug abuse is something that ruins one’s life and leads to great grief and misery. Drug abuse implies the use of drugs in a 
        way that harms the body of an individual. If drugs are taken beyond the subscribed limit, they negatively affect the body and
        poses a great threat to life. It leads to serious mental and physical deterioration. Drug abuse not only affects the 
        individual who is a victim to it but also destroys and tears apart their family and love life. People who are victims of
        drug abuse also suffer from financial loss as they do not have the potential to do any kind of work and thus it leads to
        unemployment and greater family issues.There are numerous reasons behind drug abuse, let take an insight into the things
        that lead to drug abuse . Many parents nowadays do not focus on their children as they are much busy earning their 
        livelihood. However, the children feel ignorant and thus start using drugs at an increased level which makes them addicted
        to it and ultimately make them drug addicts. So parents need to supervise their children so as to avoid such situations.  
        Then comes lack of communication, teenagers and their parents are unable to talk to each other over certain issues due to
        age gap and thus teenagers seek advice from other people who may convince them to take a drug overdose. So it’s high time
        that parents should become friends to their children and listen to their problems patiently.

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        As homelessness due to drug addiction becomes more visible in our cities there are many people who wonder if offering basic
        aid such as food, water, and clothing is enabling unhealthy behaviors. At Blanchet House of Hospitality, we believe it is a
        moral imperative to feed hungry, homeless people whether they suffer with drug addiction or other challenges. Compassion can
        open doors to recovery and a healthier future for all.When discussing the issue of helping the poor and feeding the homeless,
        it is crucial to address the specific challenges faced by individuals grappling with drug addiction. At Blanchet House of
        Hospitality, it is our founding mission to extend compassion and aid to all marginalized people and this includes people 
        who use drugs and alcohol. By offering support through nourishment, we not only address people’s immediate needs but also
        pave the way for a path to recovery and a chance at a better life.
